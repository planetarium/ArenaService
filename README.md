# What is Arena Service?

Arena Service has evolved from its original design, as outlined in [NCIP-25](https://github.com/planetarium/NCIPs/pull/25/files). Instead of being managed directly on the Nine Chronicles blockchain via state, it now operates as an independent service.

While battle results must still be verified on-chain, all other aspects, such as ticketing and season management, are handled off-chain for improved flexibility and efficiency.

This service is designed to be **open and deployable** by anyone. If you're interested in running your own Arena Service, please refer to the [Operation Guide](https://github.com/planetarium/ArenaService/wiki/Operation).

# How It Works
